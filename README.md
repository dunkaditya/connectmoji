# Connectmoji

This is the Connectmoji game. It is very similar to Connect-4, however, the rows, columns, and consecutive "pieces" for win can be changed. It is designed such that the user plays against a computer!

To run: run "npm i" to install dependencies, then run "node src/game.js" to start the game.
